## Mute Unmute Conference Calls
To use this script:
1. Open Apple's Script Editor.
2. Paste in the contents of the mute-unmute-conference-calls.applescript file.
3. Save it wherever you want.
4. Use something like [Better Touch Tool](https://folivora.ai/) to launch it based on a hotkey.

Yes it is clunky to have to copy the text file to an apple script. Yes, it means that you will not just be able to do a git pull to get the latest. But [maintaining applescript in git is hard] (https://forum.latenightsw.com/t/managing-applescript-with-git-version-control/3369/59). Also, I likely won't update this script much. Only if I find myself on Webex a lot.
